# Task list

* Reduce geom properties to intersection of drawable properties in Matplotlib and OpenCV
* Add `start_time` and `end_time` properties for geoms that span a time interval?
* Handle bold text in OpenCV (using `line_width`)
* Handle font size in OpenCV (using `font_scale`)
* Consider making sequences their own subclass(es)
* Add methods for creating geoms/geom collections from data sources (e.g., CSV, JSON)
* Add option for matplotlib methods to save output
* Figure out how to monkey-patch JSON encoder so geom objects can be handled by built-in JSON methods (and indent works)
* Add docstrings
* Turn docstrings into API documentation
